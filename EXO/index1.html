            <h1 class="title1"> CYBER BULLYING</h1> <p>
                Cyberbullying refers to the use of digital communication tools, such as social media, messaging apps,
                email, or websites, to harass, threaten, intimidate, or demean individuals. It can take various forms,
                including text messages, images, videos, or rumors spread online with the <br>intention of causing harm.
                <br><br>
                Targets: Anyone, regardless of age, can become a target of cyberbullying. However, children and
                teenagers are particularly vulnerable due to their frequent use of digital devices and social media
                platforms.
                <br><br>

                Forms of Cyberbullying: Common forms of cyberbullying include sending hurtful or threatening messages,
                spreading false rumors, sharing embarrassing photos or videos, impersonating someone online, and
                excluding individuals from online groups or activities.
                <br><br>

                Consequences: Cyberbullying can have devastating consequences for victims, including emotional distress,
                depression, anxiety, <br>low self-esteem, and even suicidal thoughts. It can also impact academic
                performance and social relationships.

        <div><h1  class="title1">ONLINE GROOMING</h1>
            <p>Online grooming refers to the process by which an adult or older individual establishes trust and
                emotional connections with a child or adolescent through online communication platforms. The ultimate
                goal is to exploit the child, often for sexual purposes, but also for other forms of manipulation,
                coercion, or harm.
                <br><br>
                Methods: Groomers use various tactics to gain a child's trust, including flattery, gifts, compliments,
                and the creation of a false persona or identity. They may pretend to share common interests and
                sympathize with the child's problems to build rapport.
                <br>

                <br>
                Consequences: Online grooming can lead to serious harm to the child, including emotional trauma, sexual
                exploitation, blackmail, and exposure to explicit content. It may also result in legal consequences for
                the groomer. <br>

                access to online content that may be unsuitable for a particular audience, especially children and

                citizenship and proactive measures can help mitigate its impact. By educating individuals, particularly
                young users, about the risks and responsibilities associated with online content, we can empower them to
                navigate the digital landscape safely and responsibly.
