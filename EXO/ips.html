                <h2>Why we should be aware of our rights?</h2>
                <p ><div>Children should be aware of their child rights for several crucial reasons. Firstly, this awareness
                    empowers them by reinforcing the idea that they have a voice and that their well-being matters. It
                    boosts their self-esteem and self-confidence. Secondly, it serves as a protective shield as children
                    can recognize when their rights are being violated, enabling them to seek support from trusted
                    adults or authorities when needed. Thirdly, an understanding of child rights transforms children
                    into advocates for themselves and others, enabling them to speak out against injustices and
                    contribute to positive change. Furthermore, it keeps them safe by teaching them about personal
                    boundaries and their right to say "no" in inappropriate or harmful situations. Additionally, it
                    imparts a sense of responsibility as children learn that rights come with responsibilities and must
                    be exercised while respecting the rights of others. Moreover, awareness of the right to education,
                    health, and a safe environment encourages children to value these aspects of their lives. It also
                    helps prevent exploitation by informing them about child labor laws and protection from
                    exploitation. Furthermore, it fosters their participation in decisions affecting them, preparing
                    them for responsible citizenship. Additionally, this knowledge equips them to recognize signs of
                    abuse or neglect, facilitating early intervention and protection. Lastly, educating children about
                    their rights has a long-lasting impact, shaping them into adults who value justice, equality, and
                    fairness in society and work towards creating an inclusive and just world.</div>

<br><br>
                    <span>Preparedness for Adulthood:</span> <div>Knowledge of child rights prepares children for responsible citizenship
                        as they grow older. They learn about the principles of justice, equality, and fairness, which are
                        fundamental in any society.</div>
<br><br>
                    <span>Preventing Abuse and Neglect:</span> <div>When children are aware of their rights, they are more likely to
                        recognize signs of abuse or neglect in themselves or their peers, leading to early intervention and
                        protection.</div>
<br><br>
                   <span> Legal Protection:</span> <div>In cases where children's rights are violated, awareness can help them or their
                    guardians seek legal remedies and support from child protection agencies and advocacy organizations.</div>
                    <br><br>

                    <span>Long-term Impact:</span> <div>Educating children about their rights can have a long-lasting impact, as they grow
                        into adults who understand the importance of respecting the rights of others and working towards a
                        just and inclusive society.
    
                        In summary, raising awareness about child rights is vital for the well-being and development of
                        children. It empowers them, protects them from harm, and equips them with the knowledge and skills
